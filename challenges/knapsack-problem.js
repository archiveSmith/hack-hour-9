/*
  You have a knapsack with a weight limit.
  You are presented with an array of objects, each with its own weight and value.
  Find the maximum value you can fit into your knapsack.

  e.g.
  items = [{weight: 1, value : 3}, {weight: 2, value : 4}, {weight: 3, value : 5}];
  solveKnapsack(items, 3); // returns 7 (from items[0] and items[1])
  solveKnapsack(items, 5); // returns 9 (from items[1] and items[2])
